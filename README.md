# cc-svelte-datatable
A generic Svelte Datatable.

Builds on:

## Get started

[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) is recommended for package management.
Due to an issue with Yarn v2 you have to stick to Yarn v1.

Install the dependencies...

```bash
yarn install
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
yarn run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.
Usually on save of source files the page should reload automatically.
